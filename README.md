Rails Admin plugin to clone existing records

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rails_admin_clone.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/rails_admin_clone)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dalpo/rails_admin_clone.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dalpo/rails_admin_clone)

## Installation

To enable rails_admin_clone, add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'rails_admin_clone'
gem 'rails_admin'
```
**Important:** `rails_admin_clone` must be defined before `rails_admin` to work correctly.


Add in your `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb` initializer the configuration:
```ruby
RailsAdmin.config do |config|
  config.actions do
    dashboard
    index
    new
    export
    history_index
    bulk_delete
    show
    clone   # Add the clone action
    edit
    delete
    history_show
    show_in_app
  end
end
```

## Options
You can specify a custom model method to clone objects with the following configuration:
```ruby
RailsAdmin.config do |config|
  config.model Post do
    clone_config do
      custom_method :my_custom_clone_method
    end
  end
end
```

Here an implementation example for a clone `custom_method`:
```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base

  ...

  def my_custom_clone_method
    self.dup.tap do |post|
      post.status = :draft
      post.slug   = nil
      post.title  = "Copy of #{self.title}"
    end
  end

end
```

Note: for an easy way to clone ActiveRecord objects including their associations, take a look at [Amoeba Gem](https://github.com/rocksolidwebdesign/amoeba)
